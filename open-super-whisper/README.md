## Download

You can download the latest executable file (.exe) for Windows from our [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/TakanariShimbo/open-super-whisper/releases).

## Requirements

- Windows or macOS operating system
- Internet connection (for initial model download)

## Installation

### Using UV Package Manager

[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast and efficient Python package installer and environment manager. It's faster than traditional pip and venv, and provides better dependency resolution.

1. Check if UV is installed:

```bash
uv --version
```

2. If not installed, you can install it with:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

3. Clone or download this repository

4. Set up the project using UV's sync command, which will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

5. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1

# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

> **Note**: If you get a "execution of scripts is disabled on this system" error when using `activate.ps1` in PowerShell, try one of these solutions:
> 
> 1. Use Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and run `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` instead
> 2. Run the following command in PowerShell to change the execution policy for the current session only:
>    ```powershell
>    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
>    ```
>    Then run `.\.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1`
> 3. Run PowerShell as Administrator and change the execution policy for your user account (do this only if you understand the security implications):
>    ```powershell
>    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
>    ```

6. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Building the Application

To create a standalone executable, you can use PyInstaller:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --icon assets/icon.ico --name "OpenSuperWhisper" --add-data "assets;assets" main.py

# For macOS
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --icon assets/icon.icns --name "OpenSuperWhisper" --add-data "assets:assets" main.py

# For Linux
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --icon assets/linux_pngs/icon_256.png --name "OpenSuperWhisper" --add-data "assets:assets" main.py
```

The Windows command does the following:
- `--onefile`: Creates a single executable file
- `--windowed`: Prevents a console window from appearing
- `--icon assets/icon.ico`: Sets the application icon
- `--name "OpenSuperWhisper"`: Specifies the output filename
- `--add-data "assets;assets"`: Includes the entire assets directory in the executable

Once the build is complete, you'll find `OpenSuperWhisper.exe` in the `dist` folder on Windows, `OpenSuperWhisper.app` in the `dist` folder on macOS, or `OpenSuperWhisper` in the `dist` folder on Linux.

## Usage

### First Launch

1. On first launch, the application will automatically download the Whisper model

3. The application will automatically transcribe your recording
4. You can also use the global hotkey (default: Ctrl+Shift+R) to start/stop recording even when the application is in the background

### Using Global Hotkeys

1. The default hotkey is set to "Ctrl+Shift+R"
2. Pressing this hotkey will start/stop recording even when the application is in the background
3. To change the hotkey, click "Hotkey Settings" in the toolbar

### Using the System Tray (Windows) or Menu Bar (macOS)

1. The application stays resident in your system tray (Windows) or menu bar (macOS)
2. Closing the window will keep the application running in the background

   - "Add proper punctuation"
   - "Format text into paragraphs"
3. These instructions help refine transcription results without manual editing

### Managing Transcriptions

1. View the transcription in the main text area
2. Edit the text if needed (the text area is editable)
3. Use the toolbar buttons to:
   - Copy the transcription to clipboard

### Other Settings
